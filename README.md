An in vitro model of human ovarian follicles would greatly benefit the study of female reproduction. Ovarian development requires the combination of germ cells and their supporting somatic cells, known as granulosa cells. Whereas efficient protocols exist for generating human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) from human iPSCs, a method of generating granulosa cells has been elusive. Here we report that simultaneous overexpression of two transcription factors (TFs) can direct the differentiation of human iPSCs to granulosa-like cells. We elucidate the regulatory effects of several granulosa-related TFs, and establish that overexpression of NR5A1 and either RUNX1 or RUNX2 is necessary and sufficient to generate granulosa-like cells. Our granulosa-like cells form ovary-like organoids (ovaroids) when aggregated with hPGCLCs, and recapitulate key ovarian phenotypes including support of germ cell maturation, follicle formation, and steroidogenesis. This model system will provide unique opportunities for studying human ovarian biology, and may enable the development of therapies for female reproductive health.
