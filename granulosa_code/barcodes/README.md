# barcode-matching

This code is for matching Illumina reads to a list of short DNA barcodes. It requires that BBtools are installed, for merging paired-end reads. The inputs are a directory containing .fastq.gz files, and a list of barcodes. The output is a .csv file of barcode counts. Matching is performed by alignment; see comments in `illumina_align_known_barcodes.py`

Example command:
`./known-barcode-align-parallel.sh test-data barcode_list_for_alignment.csv test-output.csv`

The test data was generated by a MiSeq.
